I am a Ph.D. candidate at Graduate School of Information Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo. My research interests include mathematical optimization and its applications to control, machine learning, and other fields.

Currently, I am working remotely due to health reasons. 

Supervisor: Professor [Akiko Takeda](https://www.or.mist.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/takeda/index-e.html)
